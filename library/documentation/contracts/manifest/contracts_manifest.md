# Manifest Contract

This document defines the **required structure, meaning, and authority** of a Manifest node.

Every portable Twilite graph **must** have a Manifest that conforms to this contract.
A Manifest may be **explicit** (a Manifest node) or **implicit** (auto-materialized at load time).
If the Manifest is implicit, the graph is treated as a **fragment** by default.

The Manifest is the highest authority in a graph.  
No editor, agent, or tool may override it.

---

## 1. Required Node Type

```json
{
  "type": "manifest"
}
```

There MUST be exactly **one authoritative** Manifest per graph.
A graph with no Manifest node is assumed to have an **implicit Manifest**, and is therefore a **fragment**.
Files may contain multiple Manifest nodes; **the first Manifest in file order is authoritative**.

---

## 2. Identity Section (REQUIRED)

Defines what this graph **is**.

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "graphId": "uuid-v4",
    "name": "Human readable name",
    "version": "semver",
    "description": "Short description of purpose",
    "createdAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "updatedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
  }
}
```

### Rules
- `graphId` is immutable forever
- `version` must follow semver
- `updatedAt` must change on any mutation
- Tools may read identity, never rewrite it (except `updatedAt`)

---

## 3. Intent & Scope Section (REQUIRED)

Declares **how this graph is meant to be interpreted**.

```json
{
  "intent": {
    "kind": "graph | fragment | documentation | workflow | simulation | circuit | knowledge-map | contract | executable | other",
    "scope": "human | agent | tool | mixed",
    "description": "Optional clarification of intent"
  }
}
```

### Rules
- Intent constrains interpretation, not rendering
- If the Manifest is implicit, `intent.kind` is treated as `fragment`
- Editors MUST NOT guess intent
- Agents MUST respect intent when acting
- Unknown intent values are allowed but must be treated as opaque

---

## 4. Dependencies & Requirements Section (REQUIRED)

Declares what must exist for this graph to be valid.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "nodeTypes": ["markdown", "default", "script", "customType"],
    "portContracts": ["core", "breadboard"],
    "skills": ["auto-layout", "schema-validation", "batch-mutation"],
    "schemaVersions": {
      "nodes": ">=1.0.0",
      "ports": ">=1.0.0"
    },
    "optional": []
  }
}
```

### Rules
- Missing required dependencies MUST invalidate execution
- Editors may warn but must not silently degrade
- Agents must refuse to act if dependencies are unmet
- Skill dependencies are mandatory and must include any skills declared by node definitions
- Optional dependencies must never be assumed
- Version mismatches MUST warn only unless explicitly marked as blocking in the Manifest
- Dictionary precedence: host graph dictionary is authoritative; imported definitions may include dictionaries but must be merged explicitly

---

## 5. Authority & Mutation Policy Section (REQUIRED)

Defines **what is allowed to change** and by whom.

```json
{
  "authority": {
    "mutation": {
      "allowCreate": true,
      "allowUpdate": true,
      "allowDelete": false,
      "appendOnly": true
    },
    "actors": {
      "humans": true,
      "agents": true,
      "tools": true
    },
    "graphBoundary": "none | root | cluster",
    "styleAuthority": "descriptive | authoritative | ignored",
    "history": {
      "rewriteAllowed": false,
      "squashAllowed": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Rules
- If `appendOnly` is true, deletes are forbidden
- If `allowDelete` is false, tools must block deletion
- If agents are disabled, they may only read
- History rules must be enforced by editors and agents
- Style authority controls whether renderers must obey style nodes
- `graphBoundary` controls how much of the file is treated as the active graph
  - `none`: load full file (no boundary)
  - `root`: load only the manifest-rooted subgraph (stop at other Manifests)
  - `cluster`: load only the cluster containing the Manifest node (if any)
- **Reachability rule (root boundary):**
  - Only **structural edges** extend authority: `contains` and legacy `child`
  - **Cluster membership** is structural for nodes in the same file/scope
  - All other edge types are **non-structural** and do not confer authority
- **Cluster constraint:** clusters must only reference local nodes; external IDs are ignored and should warn

---

## 6. Validation Rules

A Manifest is valid only if:
- Exactly one exists
- All required sections exist
- All required fields exist
- Dependency sets are closed
- Mutation policy is internally consistent
- Version format is valid semver
- UUIDs are valid RFC 4122 v4

Invalid Manifests invalidate the entire graph.

---

## 7. Document Reference (OPTIONAL)

Documents are part of the graph’s portable definition.

```json
{
  "document": {
    "url": "https://example.com/background.html"
  }
}
```

### Rules
- Stored inside the Manifest node as `data.document.url`
- If omitted, there is no external document
- Renderers may treat this as a background/host document when available

---

## 8. Document Settings (OPTIONAL)

Settings define **how the graph should be presented by default**.  
These are editor-facing defaults and may be overridden by a renderer.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "theme": null,
    "backgroundImage": null,
    "defaultNodeColor": "#1976d2",
    "defaultEdgeColor": "#666666",
    "snapToGrid": false,
    "gridSize": 20,
    "edgeRouting": "auto",
    "layout": null,
    "github": null,
    "autoSave": false
  }
}
```

### Rules
- Settings live inside the Manifest node as `data.settings`
- If settings are omitted, renderers must fall back to their own defaults
- Settings must never override Manifest authority rules

---

## 9. Forbidden Patterns

Manifest nodes MUST NOT:
- Be duplicated within a single authoritative graph
- Be deleted in portable graphs
- Be silently modified
- Be inferred
- Be auto-generated without explicit user intent
- Be ignored by tools

    },
    "dependencies": {

      "skills": [],
      "schemaVersions": {
        "nodes": ">=1.0.0",
        "ports": ">=1.0.0"
      }
    },
    "authority": {
      "mutation": {
        "allowCreate": true,
        "allowUpdate": true,
        "allowDelete": false,
        "appendOnly": true
      },
      "actors": {
        "humans": true,
        "agents": true,
        "tools": true
      },
      "graphBoundary": "none",
      "styleAuthority": "descriptive",
      "history": {
        "rewriteAllowed": false,
        "squashAllowed": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Final Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If a tool or agent does not understand this Manifest,  
it must **refuse to act**.

Silence is corruption.  
Refusal is safety.
